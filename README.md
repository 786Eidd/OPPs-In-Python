  - Multiple Inheritance
# Objectives: 
By the end of this course, you will be able to:

Understand and apply the fundamental concepts of classes and OOPs in Python.
Effectively use class methods and understand the role of self in object-oriented code.
Implement inheritance to create hierarchical class structures and promote code reuse.
Apply encapsulation to safeguard data and manage access within your classes.
Utilize polymorphism to write flexible code that can work with different object types.
Differentiate between class and instance variables and use them appropriately.
Implement static methods to create utility functions within classes.
Use property decorators for clean, Pythonic access to class properties.
Leverage isinstance() and class inheritance checks for robust type handling.
Implement multiple inheritance and understand Python’s method resolution order (MRO) to manage complex class relationships.

**Basics of Class and OOPs:** Learn the foundational concepts of Object-Oriented Programming, including how to define and use classes in Python to model real-world objects.
**Class Method and self:** Understand the role of self in class methods and how class methods differ from instance methods in accessing and modifying class properties.
**Inheritance:** Explore how classes can inherit attributes and methods from other classes, enabling code reusability and logical class hierarchies.
**Encapsulation:** Discover how to bundle data and methods within a class, and control access to the data by using public, protected, and private attributes.
**Polymorphism:** Learn how objects of different classes can share the same method name, allowing for flexible and reusable code through method overriding and interface implementation.
**Class Variables:** Understand the difference between instance and class variables and how class variables are shared across all instances of a class.
**Static Method:** Study static methods, which belong to the class rather than any instance and do not require self or cls as parameters.
**Property Decorators:** Explore Python’s @property decorator for creating managed attributes, enabling a more Pythonic way to define getters, setters, and deleters.
**Class Inheritance and isinstance() Functions:** Delve into the concept of checking an object’s type using isinstance() and how it relates to class inheritance.
**Multiple Inheritance:** Understand how a class can inherit from multiple parent classes, the benefits of this approach, and how Python handles method resolution in such scenarios.

# Conclusion: 
Mastering Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python equips you with the skills to design modular, reusable, and scalable code. Understanding the key concepts such as classes, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and more empowers you to build efficient software that models complex systems effectively. With OOP principles, you can write cleaner code that’s easier to maintain and extend, making you a more proficient Python developer.
